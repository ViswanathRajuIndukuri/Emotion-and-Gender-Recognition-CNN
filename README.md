This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow to recognize and classify facial expressions into distinct categories based on gender and emotion. The goal is to accurately predict four combined categories: HappyMale, HappyFemale, SadMale, and SadFemale.

## Project Objectives

1. **Develop Individual Models**:
    - *Gender Recognition Model*: Classify images as male or female.
    - *Emotion Recognition Model*: Classify images as happy or sad.
2. **Integrate Model Predictions**: Cross-utilize the predictions from both models to enrich the dataset.
3. **Create a Unified Dataset**: Combine predictions to form a comprehensive dataset with dual labels.
4. **Train a Unified Model**: Develop a model that predicts the four combined categories.
5. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the model's accuracy and efficiency across various metrics.
6. **Generalize Model Application**: Ensure the model performs well on unseen data.
