This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow to recognize and classify facial expressions into distinct categories based on gender and emotion. The goal is to accurately predict four combined categories: HappyMale, HappyFemale, SadMale, and SadFemale.

### Developed Individual Models
- **Gender Recognition Model**: Built and trained a CNN that accurately classifies images as male or female.
- **Emotion Recognition Model**: Developed a separate CNN for emotion recognition, capable of classifying images as happy or sad.

### Integrated Model Predictions
- Implemented a method to cross-utilize predictions from both the gender and emotion models, enriching our dataset and improving prediction accuracy.

### Created a Unified Dataset
- Combined the predictions from both the gender and emotion recognition models to create a unified dataset with comprehensive dual labels.

### Trained a Unified Model
- Developed a robust unified CNN model that predicts four combined categories: HappyMale, HappyFemale, SadMale, and SadFemale, showcasing effective multi-label classification.

### Evaluated Model Performance
- Rigorously tested the unified model across various metrics to assess its accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating high performance and robustness.

### Generalized Model Application
- Ensured the model performs well on unseen data, validating its effectiveness and generalizability for practical deployment.
